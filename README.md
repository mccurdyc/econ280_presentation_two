# seke2015-panel-presentation

This repository contains the HTML source code and additional resources
for a presentation that I, [Colton J. McCurdy](http://www.coltonmccurdy.com), gave in my Introduction to Entrepreneurship Course.
The presentation's source code uses the
[reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) framework to control
the display of each slide. [Gregory M. Kapfhammer](http://www.cs.allegheny.edu/sites/gkapfham/) has developed a
custom theme for the display of the slides and the use of full-screen
photographs on the backgrounds.

You are welcome to use these slides as inspiration for your own
presentation. If you find this example useful, could I
trouble you to star
[this](https://github.com/gkapfham/seke2015-panel-presentation) repository and then acknowledge it in your own
presentation slides?

Please refer to [Gregory M.
Kapfhammer's](https://github.com/gkapfham/seke2015-panel-presentation),
the original creator of this HTML presentation. There, you will find
installation instructions. I ask that you `clone` his repository instead
of this repository to give Gregory M. Kapfhammer credit for his work.
While there, star the repository!
